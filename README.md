AiNumRead means artificial intelligence number reader.

The aim of the project is to create a simple, self-trainable environment for recognizing numbers on images.

The project should be usable independently as well as as a library. It should also be usable as a UI as well as a console version. A limitation to one operating system is not intended. So far the project is written in Python.
